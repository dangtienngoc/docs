With the release of [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/blog/create-next-app), bootstrapping a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app is now a guided process that allows you to get up and running in seconds by using ready made examples.

This guide walks you through creating a [Next.js guestbook app](https://nextjs-graphql-faunadb.now-examples.now.sh) that receives data from a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API powered by [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/), and how to deploy it with ZEIT Now.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Next.js App

Set up your bootstrapped Next.js app with [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and move into the project directory:

<Snippet dark text="npx create-next-app --example with-graphql-faunadb my-nextjs-guestbook && cd my-nextjs-guestbook" />
<Caption>Initializing a Next.js, GraphQL, and FaunaDB app with <Link href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx">npx</Link> and moving into the project directory.</Caption>

By including the `with-graphql-faunadb` argument, `create-next-app` bootstraps an app based off of a template found in the [Next.js examples repository](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples).

## Step 2: Deploying Your Next.js App with ZEIT Now

With your Next.js, app set up, it is ready to deploy live with [Now](/docs/v2).

Using [Now CLI](/download), deploy your website with **a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

If you want to deploy your Next.js site when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and the [production domain](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/custom-domains/#adding-a-domain) updated on push to master.
